The DeepCASE package offers both a commond-line tool for easy access and a rich API for full customisation.
This section gives a high-level overview of the different steps taken by DeepCASE to perform a contextual analysis of security events and explains how DeepCASE clusters events to reduce the workload of security analysts.
We also include several working examples to guide users through the code.
For detailed documentation of individual methods, we refer to the :ref:`Reference` guide.
